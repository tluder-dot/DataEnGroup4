# Work plan until session 5

**Goal:** project steps 1 to 4 complete, reviewed and merged by **Sunday
25 October, 20:00**. Steps 2 and 3 are already late. Step 4 is due before
session 5. The deliverables and "done when" lines below come from the course
brief.

How to work (setup, names, review rules): [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Who owns what

| Member | Owns | ADR | Reviews the PRs of |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Till** | Step 1, repo setup, batch ingestion (extractor and Airbyte connector), data dictionary, `docs/architecture.md` | 0001 (done) | Evaluna |
| **Evaluna** | Step 2: group bucket, bronze, lifecycle, access, costs | 0002 bronze layout | Jane |
| **Jane** | Step 3: the clickstream consumer, its schema and dead letter queue, failure modes | 0003 ingestion modes | Enzo |
| **Enzo** | Step 4: native tables, tuning, materialised view, cost cap, runbook | 0004 warehouse pricing | Till |

Reviews go round in a circle, so each of us reads one other area closely. At
the defence, everyone is asked about an ADR they did not write.

## Timeline

| When | What |
|---|---|
| **Wed 21 Oct** | **Everyone:** set up your machine (CONTRIBUTING.md §1), review your step 1 PR(s) below, and make your first commit: your own row in the README team table (GitHub handle and role). **Evaluna:** create the bucket and the dataset (E1) and post in the group when they exist |
| **Thu 22 Oct** | **Evaluna:** bronze landed, with external tables over the seven tables (E2). Enzo's work depends on it, so it comes first |
| **Sat 24 Oct, 20:00** | Every PR open and ready for review |
| **Sun 25 Oct, 20:00** | Everything reviewed and merged. Till updates `docs/architecture.md` last |
| **Before session 5** | **Everyone, alone:** the L05 setup (bottom of this page) |

### Step 1 reviews (Wednesday)

| PR | What | Reviewer |
|---|---|---|
| #2 | Data flows | Evaluna |
| #3 | ADR-0001: target architecture | Jane |
| #4 | Architecture v1 | Jane |
| #5 | Star schema sketch | Enzo |
| #7 | This plan and CONTRIBUTING.md | Evaluna |

## Till

**T1 · Step 1 and repo setup.** Fixes to PRs #2 to #5, CONTRIBUTING.md, this
plan.
*Done when:* PRs #2 to #5 and #7 are merged after review, and every member
has a commit on `main`.

**T2 · Extractor:** `ingestion/extract_orders.py` (step 3, deliverable 2).
- Plain SQL through a database driver (`psycopg`), no ORM. Credentials come
  from `DATABASE_URL`.
- Reads incrementally, with a cursor on `order_date` that survives a restart.
- Retries a failed connection with a growing delay, then gives up.
- Writes partitioned Parquet into `bronze/`, following ADR 0002.

*Done when:* a second run reads only new rows, and a stopped database gives
retries, then a clean failure. Record `>` versus `>=` and what the cursor
misses, for ADR 0003.

**T3 · Connector (Airbyte Cloud):** step 3, deliverable 1.
- **First, ask Charles what counts as the connector.** Airbyte Cloud cannot
  reach the PostgreSQL running on our laptops.
- The seven tables: `orders`, `order_items`, `review`, `product_reviews`,
  `product`, `customer_shipping`, `shipping_details`.
- Secret columns deselected in the connection: `customer.pwd`,
  `payment_details.card_no`, `cvv`.
- Commit the exported config or screenshots to `ingestion/airbyte/`. Write
  down what credentials it holds and how to revoke them.

**T4 · Data dictionary v1:** `docs/data-dictionary.md` (step 2,
deliverable 3).
- Every landed table and every column: name, type, meaning, and whether it is
  personal data. Mark the names, emails, addresses and phones, the legacy
  passwords and the card data.
- Say which path each table came from. Airbyte adds `_airbyte_raw_id`,
  `_airbyte_extracted_at`, `_airbyte_meta` and `_airbyte_generation_id`; the
  extractor adds none.

*Done when:* column names and types match what Evaluna landed.

**T5 · `docs/architecture.md`, steps 2 to 4.**
- Step 2: the bucket, region, layout and who can read it.
- Step 3: three arrows into bronze.
- Step 4: the native tables.
- One change-log row per lesson, and ADRs 0002 to 0004 in the decisions
  table.

## Evaluna: step 2, bronze

**E1 · Bucket and dataset (Wednesday, first).**

```
gcloud storage buckets create gs://data-engineering-i1-g04 --location=europe-west1 --uniform-bucket-level-access
```

Then, in the BigQuery console: create the dataset `g04_bronze`, location
`europe-west1`. Post in the group when both exist.

**E2 · The export as partitioned Parquet** (step 2, deliverable 1).
- Commit the script that does it, `ingestion/land_export.py`, so it can be
  rerun.
- Files go to `gs://data-engineering-i1-g04/bronze/<table>/`.
- Bronze holds what arrived, unchanged: no cleaning, no deduplication, no
  dropped rows.
- Pandas' defaults change data on the way in. A phone number loses its
  leading zero, and the strings `None`, `NA`, `N/A` and `NULL` become nulls.
  Decide how you read types, and say so in ADR 0002.
- Two decisions to argue in ADR 0002:
  - **The partition key, per table.** `order_items` has no date column, and
    small tables may need no partitions at all.
  - **The secret columns.** The brief says bronze is unchanged, but ADR-0001
    says `customer.pwd`, `payment_details.card_no` and `cvv` are never
    extracted. Choose, and justify the choice.
- External tables `g04_bronze.<table>_external` (`WITH PARTITION COLUMNS`),
  at least for the seven tables listed in T3.

*Done when:* `COUNT(*)` on the external tables matches the export, for
example 222,644 orders and 408,560 order lines.

**E3 · ADR 0002:** `docs/adr/0002-bronze-layout.md`.
- **Decision:** partition key, format, codec.
- **Options:** at least one other key, and CSV.
- **Evidence:** Exercise 1 numbers, yours or Till's (PR #6): 279× more
  objects, 88× more bytes, 3.7× slower, the same bytes processed.
- **Consequences:** what is cheap, what is awkward, what would force a
  rewrite.

**E4 · Lifecycle and access as files:** `infra/lifecycle.json` and
`infra/iam.md`.
- `lifecycle.json` is the policy actually applied to the group bucket, with
  no delete rule, and the reason why:
  `gcloud storage buckets update gs://data-engineering-i1-g04 --lifecycle-file=infra/lifecycle.json`
- `iam.md` lists every binding on the bucket and the dataset: principal, role,
  scope, and a one-line reason. Copy it from reality:
  `gcloud storage buckets get-iam-policy gs://data-engineering-i1-g04`.
  We cannot create service accounts in this project: say so.

*Done when:* both files match `gcloud storage buckets describe` and
`get-iam-policy`.

**E5 · Costs:** `docs/costs.md`.
- Monthly cost from published prices, with the date you read them: storage,
  operations (from your object count), and what changes at 100 times the data.
- Others extend it in later steps.

## Jane: step 3, the stream

**J1 · Consumer:** `ingestion/consume_clickstream.py` (deliverable 3).
- Start from the course's `consume_clickstream.py` (L03, Exercise 1 page).
- It reads topic `clickstream` on `localhost:9092`.
- It writes partitioned Parquet to
  `gs://data-engineering-i1-g04/bronze/clickstream/`. Decide whether to
  partition by `event_time` or `emitted_at`, and say why.
- The docstring states the delivery guarantee in one sentence, and the code
  matches it. For example, the offset is committed after the file is written:
  at least once.

**J2 · Schema and dead letter queue:** `ingestion/clickstream.schema.json`
(deliverables 4 and 5).
- A JSON Schema for the event: `schema_version`, `event_id`, `event_type`,
  `event_time`, `emitted_at`, `session_id`, `buyer_id`, `p_id`, `qty`.
- The consumer validates each event before accepting it, and
  `schema_version` picks the schema.
- Failed events go to `bronze/_dlq/clickstream/` with the row, the reason and
  the time. One bad row must not stop the flow.

*Done when:* a deliberately broken event, sent with
`kafka-console-producer.sh`, sits in `_dlq/` and the consumer kept running.

**J3 · The evidence** (L03 Exercise 1, steps A and B).
- Kill the consumer between the write and the commit, restart it, then count
  rows against distinct `event_id`: that gives the duplicate count.
- CDC: create a slot, insert, update and delete a test product, peek at the
  changes, note the slot size, then **drop the slot**. An unread slot holds
  log on disk. Note which change an `order_date` cursor misses.

**J4 · Failure modes:** `docs/ingestion-failure-modes.md` (deliverable 6).
- A table: failure, handled?, by what, what happens.
- It covers at least: new rows, updates, deletes, source down, malformed row,
  schema change, duplicate after restart, expiring credential.
- It says where credentials live.
- At least one honest "not handled".

**J5 · ADR 0003:** `docs/adr/0003-ingestion-modes.md` (deliverable 7).
- The mode per source (the database tables, the clickstream).
- At least one rejected option.
- Evidence from J3 and from Till's extractor.
- The guarantee committed to, and what would force a change.

**J6 · Clickstream in the data dictionary** (deliverable 8), once T4 is
merged. Every field: type, meaning, and whether it is personal data. Answer
it for `buyer_id` and `session_id`.

## Enzo: step 4, the warehouse

Needs E2 (bronze as external tables). Until then, read the L04 lecture and
draft the queries. Before any measurement, turn the query cache off. Record
**bytes processed**, never bytes billed: billing has a 10 MiB minimum.

**N1 · The working set as native tables:** dataset `g04_warehouse`
(deliverable 1).
- Load the seven tables. `order_items` joins `orders` to get `order_date`.
- Say which tables you loaded and which stay external, and why.

**N2 · Tuning:** `docs/warehouse-tuning.md` (deliverables 2, 4 and 7).
- A table: table, change, query, bytes before, bytes after, ratio.
- Partition by a defended grain: three years of orders suggest month.
  Cluster where a query filters. Report the changes that bought nothing
  (1.0×) too, each with a sentence.
- Three analytical queries the project needs: SQL, bytes processed, cost at
  $7.50 per TiB, tuned versus untuned.
- `maximum_bytes_billed`: where it is set, the value and why, and the exact
  error it gives.

**N3 · Daily demand materialised view:** `warehouse/daily_demand.sql`
(deliverable 3), plus the collapse ratio, order lines ÷ distinct (product,
day), in N2's document. At about 1.14 the view saves no bytes under
per-byte billing. Keep it and say what it costs, or show a coarser grain that
moves the ratio.

**N4 · ADR 0004:** `docs/adr/0004-warehouse-pricing.md` (deliverable 5).
- On demand or capacity: the workload in numbers, and the crossover
  arithmetic.
- The decision and its cost.
- What would change your mind, as a number someone can watch.

**N5 · Runbook:** `docs/runbooks/slow-query.md` (deliverable 6).
- "A 2-second query now takes 2 minutes", written for a teammate at 23:00.
- Ordered steps, where to click, and when to escalate.
- It covers: lost partition filter, table outgrew its grain, one stage
  dominates, skew, data changed shape, cached comparison.

**N6 · Costs:** add the warehouse section to `docs/costs.md`, after E5 is
merged.

## Everyone, alone, before session 5: the L05 setup

About 20 minutes; the course's "Before the session: Docker and dbt" page.

1. Start Docker Desktop.
2. `docker pull charlestng/dbt-bigquery:1.12.1`
3. `gcloud auth application-default login`
4. In a folder outside this repo (`~/de/l05`), write `profiles.yml`
   (project `data-engineering-i1`, dataset `l05_<your initials>`, location
   `europe-west1`) and `dbt_project.yml`.
5. Run `dbt debug` in the container until it prints **All checks passed!**

The seven tables the setup checks for are `g04_bronze`'s external tables.

## Not in this plan

- The Exercise 2 PDFs: each of us writes them after the project work.
- Till's L02 Exercise 1 page (PR #6).
