# Data dictionary

**Version 1 (L02).** Every table of the v1.0.0 export (`legacy_csv`, 27 CSV
files) and every column: its type, what it means, and whether it is personal
data.

Where the content comes from:

- **Columns, row counts and every count below:** profiled from the CSV files on
  2026-10-20, reading every value as text.
- **Types:** the source schema, in the company repo's `db/migrations/`
  (PostgreSQL 17). Bronze types depend on how the export is landed
  ([ADR 0002](adr/)), and are added here once it is.
- **Meanings:** the schema, the company repo's
  [dataset card](https://github.com/TangoAI-AlbertSchool-Data-Eng-Cloud/albert-marketplace/blob/main/docs/dataset-card.md),
  and the data itself.

## Personal data: what the marks mean

| Mark | Means | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Yes · never ingest** | Credentials and card secrets. Deselected at extraction and never reach the platform ([ADR-0001](adr/0001-target-architecture.md)) | `customer.pwd`, `payment_details.card_no`, `cvv` |
| **Yes · contact** | Identifies or reaches one person directly | name, email, phone, street address |
| **Yes · location** | Where a person lives, coarser than the street | town, region, postcode, country |
| **Yes · card** | Card data that is not a secret | expiry date |
| **Yes · identifier** | A stable ID for one person. Pseudonymous, which is still personal data (GDPR Art. 4(5)) | `c_id`, `buyer_id`, `seller_id` |
| **Unclassified** | Free text and user uploads. They can contain anything, and the schema cannot tell | `review.r_desc`, `title`, `review_img` |
| **No** | Not about a person | prices, product data, dates, keys |

A column marked **No** can still sit in a row that belongs to one person: an
order date is not personal by itself, but an order row carries a `buyer_id`.
Each table's description says when its rows belong to a person.

**The index column.** 25 of the 27 files start with a column that has an empty
header: the row number pandas wrote when the export was made (0, 1, 2…). It
is not in the source tables. pandas reads it back as `Unnamed: 0`, and a
BigQuery CSV load names it `int64_field_0`. Only `order_items` and `payment`,
added after the original extract, do not have it. The tables below list it as
*(index)*.

## Where the personal data is

| Table | Personal columns |
|---|---|
| `customer` | `c_id`, `fname`, `lname`, `phone`, `email`, **`pwd`** |
| `payment_details` | **`card_no`**, **`cvv`**, `expiry_date`, `billing_address` |
| `shipping_details` | `street_address`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `country`, `phone` |
| `buyer`, `orders`, `wishlist_item`, `cart`, `returns` | `buyer_id` |
| `review` | `buyer_id`; `r_desc` and `title` unclassified |
| `review_images` | `review_img` unclassified |
| `seller`, `seller_products`, `seller_reviews` | `seller_id` (and `seller.seller_name`, empty) |
| `customer_shipping`, `customer_payment`, `subscription` | `c_id` |

**Never ingested:** `customer.pwd`, `payment_details.card_no` and
`payment_details.cvv`, in bold above.

The other 11 tables hold no personal column: `product`, `category`,
`product_images`, `product_reviews`, `order_items`, `payment`, `shipment`,
`carrier`, `discount`, `daily_deals`, `cart_items`. `order_items` and `payment`
still belong to a buyer, through `orders`.

## Traps in the export

What a loader or a staging model has to know. Each trap belongs to exactly one
place in silver (L05).

| # | Trap | Where | What goes wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **An index column** with an empty header | 25 files, all but `order_items` and `payment` | It loads as an extra column (`Unnamed: 0`, `int64_field_0`) |
| 2 | **Leading zeros in text codes** | `customer.phone` (82,203 start with `0`), `shipping_details.phone` (125,861), `shipping_details.zip` (19,622), `p_id` (6 products, 30 order lines) | Read as numbers, they lose the zero: a 10-digit phone becomes 9 digits, and a `p_id` no longer joins |
| 3 | **Codes that already lost their zeros** | `payment_details.cvv`: 961 with one digit, 8,440 with two | Never ingested, but a reminder of what trap 2 does |
| 4 | **Strings that pandas reads as missing** | `customer.fname` (4), `review.r_desc` (13), `review.title` (21) | `None`, `NA`, `N/A`, `NULL` and `n/a` become nulls with pandas' defaults. Other spellings (`Na`, `none`) stay text |
| 5 | **Empty and blank text** | `product.p_name` (6 empty), `review.r_desc` (14 empty, 110 a single space) | Not null, but not a value either |
| 6 | **Every order twice** | `orders`, and so `order_items`, `payment`, `shipment` | Revenue and units doubled; `DISTINCT` on the order's columns removes only a fifth of the twins (L01) |
| 7 | **Float noise in prices** | `product.price` (35,205 with more than two decimals); 5 products under half a cent | Catalogue totals differ from what was paid (`price_at_purchase`, rounded to cents) |
| 8 | **Columns that are always empty** | `seller.seller_name`, `orders.discount_id` | A column of nulls that looks like data |
| 9 | **Columns with one value** | `payment.method`, `payment.status`, `review.seller_product_flag`, `shipment.shipment_type`, `customer_payment.is_default` | Nothing to filter or group on, and `seller_product_flag` contradicts the links |
| 10 | **Empty tables** | `cart`, `cart_items`, `daily_deals`, `discount`, `returns` | A model built on them returns nothing, not an error |
| 11 | **Inconsistent names** | `wishlist_item.product_id` for `p_id`; `shipping_details.state` holds European regions | Joins and meanings guessed from names go wrong |
| 12 | **A timestamp with no time zone** | `payment.created_at` | The day of a payment near midnight depends on the time zone assumed |
| 13 | **No constraints in the files** | All 27 | Keys and foreign keys hold in the source, but nothing in the CSVs enforces them |

## Still to add

- **Bronze types,** once the export is landed (Evaluna, ADR 0002).
- **The clickstream events** (L03, Jane).
- **Which path each table takes into bronze,** and the columns each path adds
  (L03, Till). Airbyte adds `_airbyte_raw_id`, `_airbyte_extracted_at`,
  `_airbyte_meta` and `_airbyte_generation_id`; the hand-written extractor adds
  none.
